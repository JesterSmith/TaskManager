Software Engineering Work Sample – Task Management

Ain’t got no time for that! Productivity is the key to success for developers here at Spreetail. We use JIRA across the department, but it’s not unusual to see teams also using Trello, Wunderlist, or Todoist to help them burn through that backlog. 
Spend roughly 6 hours to create a personal task management application using a tech stack you are most comfortable with. 
Here are the requirements!

We ask that your application fulfill the following user 3 stories: 

 -As a user, I want to manage tasks and update each task’s progress
  -Completed. Added feature to create new To Do list as well. Homepage update to link to all tasks.

 -As a user, I want to be able to prioritize tasks
  -Completed. Added feature for priority sorting of ToDo List

 -As a user, I want to be able to leave descriptions, subtasks, and due dates for tasks
 
  -Completed. Added view for subtasks of a given task as well

Add a user story of your own:
Implement a feature you’d find useful for managing tasks
This is the one work sample we will be using to gauge your skills. We’re looking for depth of knowledge, creativity, and passion. The requirements are simple at a base level, but we want you to blow us away!

-Added a feature to the homepage that will show any task taht is due today.
